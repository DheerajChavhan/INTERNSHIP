        "📝 Input Paragraph: Over the past decade, education has experienced a significant shift due to rapid advancements in technology. Online learning platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy have made high-quality education accessible to millions of students worldwide. Virtual classrooms now allow real-time interaction between teachers and learners, breaking down geographical barriers. Artificial intelligence is further enhancing the learning experience through personalized tutoring, automated grading, and adaptive content delivery based on student performance. This shift has empowered students to learn at their own pace, revisit lectures, and explore diverse topics beyond their curriculum. Mobile apps and gamified learning modules are keeping learners engaged in innovative ways. However, this digital transformation also introduces challenges. Not all students have equal access to stable internet, quality devices, or a quiet learning environment at home. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction may lead to feelings of isolation and reduced motivation. As we embrace the future of education, balancing technology with human support and inclusivity remains critical.\n",

Those deeply nested callbacks made asynchronous JavaScript a real headache to read and manage. Async/Await is a modern solution, letting you write async code that *looks* synchronous and much cleaner.\\n\\n### II. What is Async/Await? (The Big Picture)\\nSimply put, Async/Await is \\\"syntactic sugar\\\" built on top of Promises, simplifying how you work with asynchronous operations. Its main goal is to make your code significantly easier to understand, write, and debug.\\n\\n### III. The `async` Keyword: Making a Function Asynchronous\\nPlacing `async` before a function declaration means that function will *always* return a Promise. If you return a regular value, JavaScript automatically wraps it in a resolved Promise. If an error occurs, it returns a rejected Promise.\\n\\n### IV. The `await` Keyword: Pausing for a Promise\\n`await` can *only* be used inside an `async` function. Put `await` before a Promise, and your `async` function will \\\"pause\\\" execution until that Promise settles (either resolves or rejects). If it resolves, `await` gives you its value; if it rejects, it throws an error.\\n\\n### V. Error Handling with `try...catch`\\nRobust code needs error handling! Happily, `try...catch` blocks work perfectly with `await`. You can catch rejected Promises just like synchronous errors, making your code resilient and predictable.\\n\\n### VI. Why Use Async/Await? (Key Benefits)\\nIt dramatically improves **readability**, making asynchronous code flow sequentially. It offers **simplicity**, reducing the complexity of nested callbacks and `.then()` chains. Plus, it boosts **maintainability**, making your code easier to debug and modify.\\n\\n### VII. Conclusion: A Smoother Async Journey\\nAsync/Await are powerful tools for managing asynchronous operations cleanly and efficiently. Start experimenting! You'll love how much clearer and more manageable your async JavaScript becomes.\",\n",
