        "> Over the past decade, education has experienced a significant shift due to rapid advancements in technology. Online learning platforms like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy have made high-quality education accessible to millions of students worldwide. Virtual classrooms now allow real-time interaction between teachers and learners, breaking down geographical barriers. Artificial intelligence is further enhancing the learning experience through personalized tutoring, automated grading, and adaptive content delivery based on student performance. This shift has empowered students to learn at their own pace, revisit lectures, and explore diverse topics beyond their curriculum. Mobile apps and gamified learning modules are keeping learners engaged in innovative ways. However, this digital transformation also introduces challenges. Not all students have equal access to stable internet, quality devices, or a quiet learning environment at home. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction may lead to feelings of isolation and reduced motivation.
